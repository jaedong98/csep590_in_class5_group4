# In-Class 5 Group 4

* Kurtis J Eveleigh
* Jae Dong Hwang


## 1. Which of the mutants in pair1, pair2, and pair3 are equivalent? Provide, for each non-equivalent mutant, a test case that kills it.
Pair 1 is non-equivalent. x=0, y=0, and z=1.
Pair 2 is equivalent. 
Pair 3 is non-equivalent. a=3, b=1, and c= 2.

## 2. Which of the four mutants in set1 are equivalent? Provide, for each non-equivalent mutant, a test case that kills it.

Mutant 4 is equivalent.

Mutant1: x=-1, y=-1
Mutant2: x=-2, y=-3
Mutant3: x=-2, y=-3

## 3. Briefly explain how scopes work in Z3 and when they are useful?


## 4. (Optional) Recall your solution for the in-class 4 exercise. Pick one of the non-equivalent mutants that you deemed equivalent and that requires reasoning about limited-precision data types. Give the mutant ID and a Z3 program that proves non-equivalence.
